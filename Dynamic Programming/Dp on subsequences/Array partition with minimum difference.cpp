Problem statement
You are given an array 'arr' containing 'n' non-negative integers.

Your task is to partition this array into two subsets such that the absolute difference between subset sums is minimum.

You just need to find the minimum absolute difference considering any valid division of the array elements.

Note:

1. Each array element should belong to exactly one of the subsets.

2. Subsets need not always be contiguous.
For example, for the array : [1, 2, 3], some of the possible divisions are 
   a) {1,2} and {3}
   b) {1,3} and {2}.

3. Subset-sum is the sum of all the elements in that subset. 
Example:
Input: 'n' = 5, 'arr' = [3, 1, 5, 2, 8].

Ouput: 1

Explanation: We can partition the given array into {3, 1, 5} and {2, 8}. 
This will give us the minimum possible absolute difference i.e. (10 - 9 = 1).
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
4
1 2 3 4
Sample Output 1:
0
Explanation for sample input 1:
We can partition the given array into {2,3} and {1,4}.
This will give us the minimum possible absolute difference i.e. (5 - 5 = 0) in this case.
Sample Input 2:
3
8 6 5
Sample Output 2:
3
Explanation for sample input 2:
We can partition the given array into {8} and {6,5}. 
This will give us the minimum possible absolute difference i.e. (11 - 8 = 3).
Expected time complexity:
The expected time complexity is O(n * ùö∫ 'arr'[i]), where ùö∫ 'arr'[i] denotes the sum of all elements in 'arr'.
Constraints:
1 <= 'n' <= 10^3
0 <= 'arr'[i] <= 10^3
0 <= ùö∫ 'arr'[i] <= 10^4, 

where ùö∫ 'arr'[i] denotes the sum of all elements in 'arr'.

Time Limit: 1sec

// Solution using subset sum problem. We know that the last row of dp contains True/False which means for that dp[index][sum]
// means whether for that index the subset with given sum is present or not. So we use this concept to find the minimum 
// partioin sum. We first find the sum of all elements. Then for every index we find the subset is possible or not. 
// Atlast after tabulation we loop at the last row of the table and 
// find for i=0 to n if(dp[n-1][i]==True) ans=min(ans, i-(sum-i)); Here one mor optimisation is possible, after sum/2 the 
//values repeat because for partitions when x is taken and with that y is also taken then for y's turn when y is considered 
// and x is also taken then both becomes same.

            {
                ans = min(ans, abs(i-(sum-i)));
            }
